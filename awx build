Build Error

ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  found unknown escape character

The error appears to be in '/opt/awx/tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/tasks/main.yml': line 51, column 46, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

      error_code: "{{ item | basename() | regex_replace('custom_(\\d+).html', '\\1') }}"
      web_path: "{{ item | regex_replace('^.*\/static', '/static') }}"
                                             ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

line 51: 
web_path: "{{ item | regex_replace('^.*\/static', '/static') }}"

modified to :
web_path: "{{ item | regex_replace('^.*\''/static', '/static') }}"

# wait for the build to complete
# docker images will show awx devel image available
make docker-compose
# wait for migrations to complete and the logs to "stop" output

# now open another terminal and run this command against the container

# this command will take a few minutes.
